# Homework 1

Your task for homework 1 will be to implement design problems from CS 142. The problems can be found in [`QUESTIONS.md`](QUESTIONS.md). your task is to discuss and implement three of them. 

For each question:

* Provide a short writeup explaining what the 'main problem' is, what decisions were made to most efficiently solve the problem. Your writeups should be done in markdown and added to the root directory of the repo (don't modify this (`README.md`) file. Nothing bad will happen if you do, though). You can look at this file for syntax. If you use a different guide for markdown, please add a link to it in your writeup. You may put all the writeups in the same file under different headings.

* Create a folder in `src/` and create any java files necessary to implement the basic solution. You may need to create multiple files to create all the necessary classes, but you don't need to add much functionality beyond solving the 'main problem'. Make sure the code for each problem is separated. Add clear and thorough comments to your code.

* Write test cases in `test/` to thoroughly and rigorously test your solution. Describe your test cases in your writeup. In particular, describe why you think you've covered all the important cases.

Your tests should all run and succeed using the testing plugin in the CodeSpace.

We will do Question 1 in class together. You may use any 3 of the remaining questions for your homework.
